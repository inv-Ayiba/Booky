                <h3>Lessons for startups:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make incremental advances</li>
                    <li>Stay lean and flexible</li>
                    <li>Improve on the competition</li>
                    <li>Focus on product</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>An explanaition of these Lessons for startups:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        1. Make incremental advances
                        Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Stay lean and flexible
                        All companies must be "lean," which is code for "unplanned." You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead, you should try things out, "iterate," and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Improve on the competition
                        Don't try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Focus on product, not sales
                        If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it's not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:
                        1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
                        2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
                        3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
                        4. Sales matter just as much as product.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h5 class="no-line-space">Another important point in the book is there's a self-serving bias when describing market conditions by both competition and monopolies.
                    </h5>
                    <p class="no-line-space">A company with a monopoly would describe the market as having multiple competitors but a company in a competitive market would try to overstate their dominance.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="no-line-space">Examples:</h6>
                    <p class="no-line-space">Monopoly Description: "We face numerous competitors, ensuring a diverse market."</p>
                    <p class="no-line-space">Competitive Market Description:"We dominate the industry, outpacing all rivals significantly."</p>
                </div>
                <h3>A Favorite Quote:</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A business either thinks money is important or money is everything.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>A monopoly will think the former (because of prosperity) and patents are monopoly tools. Okay, Peter likes monopolies.</p>
                <h3>A Note on Lawyers and Bankers:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Indefinitely optimistic future calls for more bankers and lawyers."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>üôèü§£ more talking points for me against lawyers!... bankers are on the list too.</p>
        <p>This reminds me of my HATE of the lawyer profession and how the very thought of not making anything useful for society freaks me out.</p>
        <p>I agree with Naval Ravikant when he says a world with only engineers is the way to go. Peter added bankers to the hate list.</p>
