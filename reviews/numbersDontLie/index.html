    <h2>Electricity Costs</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Original Paragraph:</strong> 
        "The levelized cost of electricity (a measure of the lifetime cost of an energy project) for new capacities entering service in 2023 is forecast to be about $60 per megawatt-hour for coal-fired steam turbogenerators with partial carbon capture, $48/MWh for solar photovoltaics, and $40/MWh for onshore wind—but less than $30/MWh for conventional gas turbines and less than $10/MWh for CCGTs."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Context and Facts:</strong> 
        The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a critical metric for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different power generation methods over their entire lifetimes. This cost includes construction, maintenance, and fuel expenses. As of 2023, coal-fired plants with partial carbon capture, which aim to reduce emissions, have a relatively high LCOE due to the additional technology required for carbon capture. Solar photovoltaics and onshore wind are more competitive, reflecting the decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies. However, conventional gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) are even cheaper. CCGTs are particularly efficient as they use both gas and steam turbines, achieving higher energy conversion efficiency. The remarkably low cost for CCGTs, less than $10/MWh, underscores their economic advantage and explains their prevalent use in electricity generation, especially in regions with abundant natural gas.

    <h2>Energy Consumption</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Original Paragraph:</strong> 
        "For example, starting with the historical context, the scientific unit of energy is one joule, and affluent economies now consume annually about 150 billion joules (150 gigajoules) of primary energy per capita (for comparison, one ton of crude oil is 42 gigajoules); while Nigeria, Africa’s most populous (and oil- and natural gas–rich) nation, averages only 35 gigajoules. The difference is impressive, with France or Japan using nearly five times as much energy per capita, but the historical comparison illuminates the real size of the gap: Japan used that much energy by 1958 (an African lifetime ago), and France averaged 35 gigajoules already by 1880, putting Nigeria’s access to energy two lifetimes behind France."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Context and Facts:</strong> 
        The joule is the basic unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI), representing the energy transferred when applying a force of one newton over one meter. In affluent economies, the high per capita energy consumption, around 150 gigajoules annually, highlights the heavy reliance on energy for industrial, residential, and transportation needs. In contrast, Nigeria, despite its substantial oil and natural gas reserves, has a much lower per capita energy consumption of 35 gigajoules. This stark difference is not just a reflection of current economic disparities but also of historical energy access. Japan reached this level of energy use in 1958, and France as early as 1880. This historical perspective emphasizes how far behind many developing nations are in terms of energy access and infrastructure, which is crucial for economic development and improving living standards.

    <h2>Airbus A380 Weight</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Original Paragraph:</strong> 
        "The maximum takeoff weight of an Airbus 380 is more than 500 tons."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Context and Facts:</strong> 
        The Airbus A380, the largest passenger airliner in the world, has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of approximately 1.2 million pounds, or over 560 tons. This massive weight includes the aircraft itself, passengers, cargo, and fuel. The A380 was designed to meet the increasing demand for air travel, accommodating up to 853 passengers in an all-economy class configuration or around 500 in a typical three-class layout. Its MTOW enables it to carry enough fuel for long-haul flights of up to 8,000 nautical miles, connecting major international hubs across the globe. The engineering marvel of the A380 also includes its wingspan of nearly 80 meters, which required the construction of special facilities and runways to handle its size.

    <h2>Food Waste Prevention</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Original Paragraph:</strong> 
        "The UK’s Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) estimates that a dollar invested in food waste prevention has a 14-fold return in associated benefits."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Context and Facts:</strong> 
        The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is a UK-based organization focused on promoting sustainable resource use. WRAP's estimate of a 14-fold return on investment in food waste prevention underscores the significant economic, environmental, and social benefits of reducing food waste. This return includes savings from reduced disposal costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and better resource efficiency. Preventing food waste also means that the resources used to produce the food, such as water, energy, and labor, are not squandered. Additionally, reducing food waste can help address food insecurity by ensuring more food reaches those in need. Globally, around one-third of all food produced is lost or wasted, highlighting the critical need for effective prevention strategies.
