          a Lifetime</h2>

        <p><strong>Book by M. J. DeMarco</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"<span style="color: #9f4a54;">The brick walls are there for a
              reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick
              walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want
              something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t
              want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people</span>!"</p>

        <p>Note: change your oil so your car doesn't "broke" down…. hehe, get
          it? I made that myself by the way. This is from Chapter 27.</p>
        <p>I really like this chapter (considering the fact I didn’t remember it
          after reading it once) as it emphasizes the need for a voracious
          learning lifestyle.</p>
        <h3>Headlines from the Book:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>I don’t know how:</strong> If you need to go somewhere,
            just go. The “how” becomes obvious. M. J. mentions how you learn by
            engaging, doing, and taking action towards those goals important to
            you.</li>
          <li><strong>Education is freely available:</strong> I saw a video
            where Will Smith (Men in Black, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) said
            there’s a book for whatever you need to do. I can take this further
            and say that this means there's a book for anything you want to be.</li>
